# MEAN ToDo App

This is a quick barebones ToDo app based on a tutorial on [Scotch.IO](http://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript/creating-a-single-page-todo-app-with-node-and-angular).

I'm using this to learn the MEAN stack as well as getting better at JavaScript. 

This will be redone to have better hierarchial structure to separate the server, db and app logic.
